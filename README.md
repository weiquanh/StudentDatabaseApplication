# StudentDatabaseApplication

Scenario: You are a Database Administrator for a university and need to create an application to manage student enrollments and balance.

The application does the following:
1. Ask the user how many new students will be added to the database
2. The user should be prompted to enter the name and year for each student
3. The student should have a 7-digit random ID
4. A student can enroll in the following courses:
      History 101
      Mathematics 101
      English 101
      Chemistry 101
      Computer Science 101
5. Each course costs $600 to enroll
6. The student should be able to view their tuition balance and pay the tuition
7. To see the status of the student, we should see their name, ID, courses enrolled, and tuition balance
